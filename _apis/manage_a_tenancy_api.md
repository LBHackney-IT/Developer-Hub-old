## Overview
{: .govuk-heading-l}

The endpoint retrieves account and contact related information based on a tag reference or a paris payment reference. The account entity represents the tenancy agreement for a property and has a link to the contacts living in that property. The API retrieves data from two entities and returns a merged result.

The API can:

 Get account information for housing residents.
 Get/update estate officers for an area and get/update area manager.
 Get citizen index search result (return a list of citizens corresponding to a search parameter).
 Assist in Tenancy Management interaction.

## Overview
{: .govuk-heading-l}

The Repairs API was developed as part of Hackney current API strategy to divide our back-end services to separate smaller API and created a microservice infrastructure. The idea is to instead of building a single API on the top of our legacy systems, several smaller APIs will be developed, all responsible for a particular business domain. The RepairsAPI is responsible for all repairs related endpoints, while other APIs are implementing functions that are used in other domains such as tenancy, address, rents etc.
